# Project 1: Public Relation Department

This project aims to segment customers based on Sentiment Analysis.

## Dataset
data source: https://www.kaggle.com/sid321axn/amazon-alexa-reviews/kernels
The Dataset contains information about customer rating, variation, verified_reviews, feedback

## Analysis
The `public relations department project.ipynb` notebook contains the following steps:
1. Data preprocessing: Cleaning and exploring the Dataset.
2. Feature engineering: Scaling the features for clustering.
3. Model building: Applying NLP.
4. Visualization: Visualizing the clusters to understand customer segments.
5. Conclusion: Summarize the findings and suggest actionable insights for marketing strategies.

## Project 3: EDA on Titanic Dataset
In this project, I have done detailed exploratory data analysis, including Univariate, bivariate and multivariate analysis.
## Dataset
This Dataset was taken from the Kaggle Titanic competition dataset. This Dataset concerns the possibility of a person surviving on a Titanic ship at that time. It has 891 instances with 12 features.

## EDA 
1. Correlation of each column with survived column has been found.
2. Conclude the role of different features in a person's survival on the ship.
3. validated using visualization graphs, bar charts, pie charts, kde plots, and box plots.
